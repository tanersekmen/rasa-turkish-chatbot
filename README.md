# Rasa Turkish Chatbot

I have developed a chatbot that gives us to analyze technical analysis of cryptocurrencies. 

I explained in a video I published on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-57fbkS9JQ


# Project Description
This project includes a chatbot that performs technical analysis of cryptocurrencies. It was developed using the Rasa framework and provides users with access to technical analysis information about various cryptocurrencies.


# How It Works
This chatbot is built on the Rasa framework and equipped with natural language processing (NLP) capabilities. Users can interact with the bot by providing text-based inputs. The bot uses NLP techniques to understand user queries, access the correct information, and generate appropriate responses.


Usage
Installation: First, clone or download the project. Then, install the Rasa framework and run the project.

`pip install rasa`


`cd rasa-turkish-chatbot`


`rasa train`


`rasa shell`
